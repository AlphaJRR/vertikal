4. **Founding 50 Email Trigger** → Sends welcome email (console log)
5. **Profile Completion** → User completes profile setup
6. **Onboarding Complete** → User is set and can access app

## 🚀 Testing Instructions

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the flow:**
   - Modal appears automatically (user is null)
   - Enter email: `test@example.com`
   - Enter code: `F50A12` (valid) or `F50M44` (already used)
   - Complete profile form
   - Check console for:
     - Verification result
     - Founding 50 email (formatted)
     - Profile save confirmation

3. **Verify email trigger:**
   - Check browser console after successful code verification
   - Email is logged with full approved copy

## 📋 Next Steps (Production)

When ready to connect to backend:

1. **Replace mock verification:**
   - Update `mockVerification.ts` to call Firebase function
   - Or connect to your verification API

2. **Integrate email service:**
   - Update `sendFounding50Email.ts` to use SendGrid/Firebase Functions
   - Or connect to your email service

3. **Save profile data:**
   - Update `ProfileCompletion.tsx` to save to database
   - Currently logs to console

4. **Mark codes as used:**
   - Update `markCodeAsUsed()` to persist to database
   - Currently only logs

## 🎯 Current State

- ✅ All UI components built and styled
- ✅ Flow is complete and functional
- ✅ Mock verification working
- ✅ Email trigger working (console)
- ✅ Profile form complete
- ✅ Ready for backend integration

## 📝 Notes

- Modal cannot be closed until onboarding is complete (user must finish)
- All validation is client-side (ready for server-side validation)
- Profile data structure matches expected format
- Founding 50 email uses exact approved copy
- All animations use Framer Motion spring physics
