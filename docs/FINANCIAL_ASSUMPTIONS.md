2. **CLV Tracking:** Average revenue per creator × 3 years
3. **Payback Period:** CAC / Monthly revenue per creator
4. **ROI:** (CLV - CAC) / CAC × 100%

### Weekly Reports:
- CAC trends (should decrease over time)
- CLV trends (should increase with better retention)
- Payback period (should decrease with optimization)
- Unit economics (should improve with scale)
