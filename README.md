# VERTIKAL — Creator Media Network (v2.0)

This repository contains:
- The legacy HTML prototype (`Folder_App v.29/`)
- Centralized structured data (`/src/data`)
- The product design blueprint and UI reference (`/docs/prototype_reference.html`)
- Preparing for migration into a full React/Next.js codebase with GitHub Copilot Workspace

## Purpose
This repo represents the foundation for the VERTIKAL app:
- Creator profiles
- Micro-series (vertical shows)
- Video feeds
- Monetization tools (tips, subscriptions)
- Founding 50 program

## Next Goals
1. Convert the legacy prototype into a component-based React/Next.js app

4. Deploy staging and production builds to Netlify  

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
