   - No exceptions

2. **One role per response. No blending.**
   - Choose either Engineering Core OR Executive Division
   - Do not mix roles in a single response

3. **No agent may override another role's authority.**
   - Respect role boundaries
   - Do not override decisions made by other roles

4. **Engineering decisions cannot be overwritten by executive tone.**
   - Technical decisions are final within engineering scope
   - Executive roles provide guidance, not technical overrides

5. **System Integrity Architect enforces compliance.**
   - JIM (System Integrity Architect) monitors protocol adherence
   - Violations trigger immediate correction

**Violations trigger immediate correction.**
