## NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

1. **SYMBOLS ARE SYSTEMS:** Every badge/logo must imply economic consequence (CPM, leverage, ownership), not just decoration.
2. **NETWORKS ARE STUDIOS:** Never describe a Network as a community. They are IP factories and monetization concentrators.
3. **INVESTORS ARE ALLOCATORS:** Use deck-grade language (Market Inefficiency, Margin Expansion, Asset Classes). No marketing fluff.
4. **REPETITION IS LAW:** If the founder stated it, it is permanent.
5. **BLACK OWNERSHIP IS STRUCTURAL:** It is a market opportunity and leverage point, not a social mission.
